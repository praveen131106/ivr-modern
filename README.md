# Milestone 4 – Testing & Deployment

This milestone adds a complete validation and deployment layer to the Conversational IVR Modernization Framework. It defines how we verify flows, guarantee quality, and package the solution for production-grade hosting.

## Scope

1. **Full-cycle testing** artifacts in this folder:
   - `test_plan.md`
   - `conversation_flow_testing.md`
   - `performance_testing.md`
   - `test_report.md`
   - `unit_tests/` (pytest suite)
2. **Deployment** assets under `deployment/` including Dockerfile, docker-compose stack, `.env.example`, hosting guidance, and the `start.sh` helper.
3. **Operational readiness** improvements such as the `/health` endpoint and automation notes referenced throughout the README.

All artifacts are linked from the root `README.md` so mentors can navigate milestone deliverables quickly.
